# An Analysis Of Outcomes From Kickstarter Campaigns Based On Launch Dates And Goals. 


## Overview Of Project: 


The Purpose for this Analysis is to Investigate Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns based on Launch Dates And Goals from The Given Kickstarter Data Set. 


### Analysis And Challenges: 


The First Part of This Analysis was about Investigating Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns based on Launch Dates from The Given Kickstarter Data Set. I followed The Instructions for Deliverable 1 Indicated on Boot Camp Spot for The First Part of This Analysis. I Created A Column called "Years" in The Kickstarter Worksheet. I Implemented The YEAR() Function to Obtain Years from The "Date Created Conversion" Column in that Worksheet. I Created A Pivot Table from The Kickstarter Worksheet and placed it into An Empty Worksheet. I Named The New Worksheet "Theater Outcomes By Launch Date." I Filtered The Pivot Table based on The "Parent Category" Column and The "Years" Column in The Kickstarter Worksheet. I Implemented The Proper Pivot Table Fields for The Columns, The Rows, and The Values. I Filtered The Labels of The Columns to Display "Successful," "Failed," and "Canceled." I Filtered The "Parent Category" Column to only Generate Data from The "Theater" Subcategory. I Sorted The Campaign Outcomes in Descending Order. I Created A Line Chart from The Pivot Table to Display The Relationship between each Launch Month and each Outcome. I Named The Line Chart "Theater Outcomes Based On Launch Date." I Didn't Encounter any Challenges for The First Part of This Analysis. Possible Challenges that can be Encountered are Relevant Functions not being Entered In Correctly and Relevant Data getting Generated into Pivot Charts or Pivot Tables not being Formatted Correctly.

The Second Part of This Analysis was about Investigating Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns based on Goals from The Given Kickstarter Data Set. I followed The Instructions for Deliverable 2 Indicated on Boot Camp Spot for The Second Part of This Analysis. I Created A New Worksheet and Named it "Outcomes Based on Goals." I Created 8 New Columns in The New Worksheet ("Goal", "Number Successful", "Number Failed", "Number Canceled", "Total Projects", "Percentage Successful", "Percentage Failed", and "Percentage Canceled"). I Created 12 New Ranges for Dollar Amounts Under The "Goal" Column in The New Worksheet (which will help Data get Classified Correctly). I Implemented The COUNTIFS() Function and The SUM() Function for Computational and Filtering Purposes. I Calculated The Percentage of Each Outcome Designation for every Row. I Created A Line Chart to Display The Relationship between each Goal and each Outcome. I Named The Line Chart "Outcomes Based On Goal." I Didn't Encounter any Challenges for The Second Part of This Analysis. Possible Challenges that can be Encountered are Relevant Functions not being Entered In Correctly and Relevant Data getting Generated into Pivot Charts or Pivot Tables not being Formatted Correctly.

#### Results: 


There are Two Conclusions that I can draw about The "Theater Outcomes Based On Launch Date" Line Chart. Successful Theater Outcomes Peak in The Month of May. Canceled Theater Outcomes seem to stay Stagnant for the most part during a Majority of Months within The Course of A Year. 

There is A Conclusion that I can draw about The "Outcomes Based On Goal" Line Chart. The "Number Canceled" Outcomes Category Always Remains at 0 and never Fluctuates.

A Limitation in Both parts of This Analysis Pertains to how there are Subcategories that have been Excluded from The Given Kickstarter Data Set. 

Some other possible Tables and Graphs that can be Created Pertain to Incorporating The Subcategories that have been Excluded in Both parts of This Analysis.
